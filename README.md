# api-blog-node

There's 2 branches - master & sqlite :

Master is an api server only runin with nodejs and storing articles as JSON
Sqlite is an api using a real database, this one can be used with the UI available here https://github.com/prisca-c/ui-api-blog-node and is also more updated than master
